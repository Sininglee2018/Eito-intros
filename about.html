			<h1>About myself and the Website</h1>
			
			<p>I'm Sining Li. A third year student currently studying in Bachalor of Information Technology and Bachalor of Science majoring in Physcis at ANU.
			Usually, I'm more like an indoor-person, perhaps you could see the point from the degree I currently in. I enjoy music, especially the J-pop, Japanese pop music. <br>
			 <br>
			My favourite band which is also an idol group is called kanjani 8. It's a seven-member boy band 
			managed by the multimedia talent agency, Johnny & Associates, and signed to Imperial Records. Like many other artists from the Company, thay have achieved enormous success. 
			However, it took them much loger time than the average groups. As the members are all from kansai area in japan, due to the then struggling kansai branch of the company, 
			they were left out at the beginning comparing to their contemporaneous colleagues. Due to their gameness and hard works over the years, they now have been recognized by the public
			and also have many fans all over the world. <br>
			 <br>
			I have been their fans for 2 years now and have always been encouraged by them. It's excited for me to share my passion towards them to other people
			Assignment_kanjani is a website offering latest and full informations about the Japanese boy band Kanjani8 to people who are fans or have interests and wish to have a 
			better anowledgement of the band. Unlike other information sites about J-pop, which only simply introduces the very basic informations about kanjani8, this website 
			will offer a comprehensive suite of the group, from basic knowledgement to past results and recognizations to the lastest news.
